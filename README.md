## ABOUT ME

Hi, I’m Srishti Gojamgunde. I’m a social data scientist specializing in statistical modeling and working with unstructured textual data to uncover and communicate the hidden stories within. My passion lies at the intersection of data, human behavior, and storytelling—exploring questions like: _How do media and technology shape our beliefs, behaviors, and mental states—and how do these individual experiences, in turn, shape the norms, policies, and technologies that define our societies? How can data-driven decision-making drive scientific progress and innovation?_ And most importantly, _how do we determine what is truly good for society?_

What I do:
- Statistical Analysis: Conduct hypothesis testing and inference using General Linear Models (e.g., regression analysis, ANOVA), Generalized Linear Models (e.g., logistic and Poisson regression), and other parametric and non-parametric methods. 
- Machine Learning & NLP: Build predictive models using supervised and unsupervised learning (tree-based models, clustering, dimensionality reduction) and analyze unstructured text for insights.
- Data Storytelling: Translate complex data into clear narratives—uncovering trends, creating visualizations, and driving meaningful conversations.

Recent Projects: 
- Modeling Political Risk in India–China Hydropower Disputes using PCA-based risk index that integrates conflict intensity, ideological distance, and economic behavior.
- Bay Wheels Operational Analysis to support infrastructure planning, enhance fleet efficiency, and promote equitable access to sustainable mobility.
- Does the New York Times Promote Overconsumption: An LDA Topic-Modeling approach to analyze thematic shifts in archival New York Times articles from 2008 versus 2024.
