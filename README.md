## ABOUT ME

Hi, I’m Srishti Gojamgunde. I’m a social data scientist specializing in statistical modeling and working with unstructured textual data to uncover and communicate the hidden stories within. My passion lies at the intersection of data, human behavior, and storytelling—exploring questions like: How does media shape people’s beliefs, attitudes, and behaviors? How do mental health and deeply held, idiosyncratic beliefs influence the societies we build? And most importantly, how do we determine what is truly good for society? 

What I do:
- Statistical Analysis: Conduct hypothesis testing and inference using Generalized Linear Models (GLMs), including regression (linear, logistic) and Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) to uncover patterns.
- Machine Learning & NLP: Build predictive models using supervised and unsupervised learning (tree-based models, neural networks, clustering, dimensionality reduction) and analyze unstructured text for insights.
- Data Storytelling: Translate complex data into clear narratives—uncovering trends, creating visualizations, and driving meaningful conversations.

Recent Projects: 
- Optimizing University Exam Scheduling: Identifying conflicts and inefficiencies using statistical tests and optimizing exam space allocations using various ML approaches.
- Keck Planet Finder Project: Detecting outliers and faulty calibrations in optical spectrometer data, supporting automated quality control.
- Topic Modeling in News & Media: Conducted LDA topic modeling using NLP to analyze trends in media coverage over time, revealing a surprising decline in topics related to the overconsumption of goods and services.
